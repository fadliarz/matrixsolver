# Matrix Solver using Gauss Jordan Elimination
This program allows you to solve a matrix that has a set of unique solutions. 

The calculation is done using Gauss Jordan Elimination. Due to high algorithm time complexity, you can only solve up to 20 linear equations.

The input format is fixed. So, wrong input format can affect to the calculation. Here is the example of the input:
2, 0, 2, 2 // row 1 <br>
5, 3, 6, 21 // row 2
0, 4, 0, 20 // row 3

This program displays the steps and the final solution as you can see below:
