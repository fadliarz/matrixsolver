# Matrix Solver using Gauss Jordan Elimination
This program allows you to solve a matrix that has a set of unique solutions.<br>

The calculation is done using Gauss Jordan Elimination. Due to high algorithm time complexity, you can only solve up to 20 linear equations.<br>

The input format is fixed. So, wrong input format can affect to the calculation. Here is the example of the input:<br><br>
<b>2, 0, 2, 2</b> // row 1 <br>
<b>5, 3, 6, 21</b> // row 2<br>
<b>0, 4, 0, 20</b> // row 3<br>

This program displays the steps and the final solution as you can see below:
