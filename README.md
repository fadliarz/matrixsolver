# Systems of Equation Matrix Solver by using Gauss Jordan Elimination

This is a tool that allows you to find the unique solution of systems of linear equation using the Gauss Jordan Elimination method.

This algorithm has a high time complexity. Based on our test, it can handle up to 20 equations efficiently. However, if the input size is larger, the calculation time may become prohibitive.

The input format is fixed. So, wrong input format can affect to the calculation. Here is the example of the input:
!!! Use "." for decimal number !!!
2, 0, 2, 2 // row 1\
5, 3, 6, 21 // row 2\
0, 4, 0, 20 // row 3
